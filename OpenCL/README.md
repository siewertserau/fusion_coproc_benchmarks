This project contains code developed by a research team at University of Colorado,Boulder and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University to explore FPGA and GP-GPU co-processor power efficiency for continous transform 3D mapping and sensor fusion.  Please use at your own risk. We are sharing so that other researchers and developers can recreate our results and make suggestions to improve and extend the benchmarks over time.  The results we obtained were documented in the SPIE Sensor and Technologies paper: S. Siewert, V. Angoth, R. Krishnamurthy, K. Mani, K. Mock, S. B. Singh, S. Srivistava, C. Wagner, R. Claus, M. Demi Vis, “Software Defined Multi-Spectral Imaging for Arctic Sensor Networks”, SPIE Algorithms and Technologies for Multipectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imagery XXII, Baltimore, Maryland, April 2016. This repository includes FPGA codes

------------
Instructions:
	1) 	Ensure you're in the Pyramidal_Jetson directory
	2) 	Make the project (type make on any Linux system)
	4) 	Run the pyramid binary, specifying the command line arguments as described below in Usage Description
	5) 	If run in a continuous transform mode, use your operating system's interrupt/kill command to exit the program
		(Ctrl+C in Linux) otherwise it will run infinitely.
   
------------   
Usage Description:
		./pyramid [-continuous [-fps=FPS]] [-img=imageFilename] [-cuda] [-h | -help | -?]
	"-img" - specific an input image other than the default 
		imageFilename can be any image stored in the (.ppm) or (.pgm) file format
	"-coninuous" - run continuous transform for power measurment, leave out if only want to run the transform once.
	"-fps" - specific the frequency you'd like the transform to run at
	"-cuda" - specify that you would like the transforms to be off-loaded onto the CUDA co-processor
	"-h | -help | -?" - show the usage description and end

Notes:
	- None

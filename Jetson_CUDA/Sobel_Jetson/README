------------
Instructions:
	1) 	Ensure you're in the Sobel_Jetson directory
	2) 	Make the project (type make on any Linux system)
	3) 	Change to the Debug directory
	4) 	Run the sobel_edge binary, specifying the command line arguments as described below in Usage Description
	5) 	If run in a continuous transform mode, use your operating system's interrupt/kill command to exit the program
		(Ctrl+C in Linux) otherwise it will run infinitely.
   
------------   
Usage Description:
		./sobel_edge [-continuous [-fps=FPS]] [-img=imageFilename] [-cuda] [-h | -help | -?]
	"-img" - specific an input image other than the default 
		imageFilename can be any image stored in the (.ppm) or (.pgm) file format
	"-coninuous" - run continuous transform for power measurment, leave out if only want to run the transform once.
	"-fps" - specific the frequency you'd like the transform to run at
	"-cuda" - specify that you would like the transforms to be off-loaded onto the CUDA co-processor
	"-h | -help | -?" - show the usage description and end
	filename.bmp can be any image stored in the bitmap (.bmp) file format
	freq can be:
		- any positive integer number to be used to set the desired frequency of continuous transform
		- zero ("0") in order to run continuous transform as fast as the hardware can and report the transform frequency
		- "-1" in order to to run the transform only once and get an output image

------------
Notes:
	- Execution detects the edges in the provided image using a Sobel filter.
